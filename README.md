## Abstract 

Structural information about protein‐protein interactions, often missing at the interactome scale, is important for mechanistic understanding of cells and rational discovery of therapeutics. Protein docking provides a computational alternative for such information. However, ranking near‐native docked models high among a large number of candidates, often known as the scoring problem, remains a critical challenge. Moreover, estimating model quality, also known as the quality assessment problem, is rarely addressed in protein docking. 

In this study, the two challenging problems in protein docking are regarded as relative and absolute scoring, respectively, and addressed in one physics‐inspired deep learning framework. We represent protein and complex structures as intra‐ and inter‐molecular residue contact graphs with atom‐resolution node and edge features. And we propose a novel graph convolutional kernel that aggregates interacting nodes’ features through edges so that generalized interaction energies can be learned directly from 3D data. The resulting energy‐based graph convolutional networks (EGCN) with multihead attention are trained to predict intra‐ and inter‐molecular energies, binding affinities, and quality measures (interface RMSD) for encounter complexes. 

Compared to a state‐of‐the‐art scoring function for model ranking, EGCN significantly improves ranking for a critical assessment of predicted interactions (CAPRI) test set involving homology docking; and is comparable or slightly better for Score_set, a CAPRI benchmark set generated by diverse community‐wide docking protocols not known to training data. For Score_set quality assessment, EGCN shows about 27% improvement to our previous efforts. Directly learning from 3D structure data in graph representation, EGCN represents the first successful development of graph convolutional networks for protein docking.

|     | Best possible |  9/6**/3*** | 9/6**/3*** | 9/6**/3*** |

 For both the benchmark and CAPRI test sets, EGCN significantly outperformed IRAD. First, for the benchmark test set of
107 cases, EGCN generated 46 targets with at least acceptable top-5
predictions (the most possible number being 70 for the decoy set),
representing more than 50% increase compared to 30 achieved by
IRAD. The performance improvement for ranking medium and highquality predictions was even more impressive: EGCN generated
21 and 5 targets with medium and high-quality top-5 predictions,
respectively, representing 62% and 150% increases compared to
IRAD. Second, for the CAPRI test set, although the total number of
targets (14) can be too few to provide statistical significance, EGCN again increased the number of at least acceptable, medium, and highquality top-5 models from IRAD's 4, 2, 0 to 6, 3, 2, respectively.
